    I am currently a first-year Master's student (Master of Engineering) at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan. <br>
    <br>I was born in Beijing, China, and came to Japan in April 2019. From 2019 to 2021, I studied at a language school, focusing on Japanese language acquisition and preparation for the EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students).xs<br>
    <br>From 2021 to 2024, I completed my undergraduate studies at a Teikyo university in Japan, earning a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from the Department of Information and Electronic Engineering. During my undergraduate program, my research focused on educational systems.<br>
    <br>I'm join in Senser Intelligent Labority in Apr. 2025 & teacher is yamanaka takao Professor<br>
    <br>Currently, in my Master's program, I have shifted my focus to the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer vision. My research interests include diffusion models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and the application of 3D graphics computing (3DGC) in panoramic imaging and 3D model reconstruction.
